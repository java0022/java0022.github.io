What I learned: 

Each assignment, for me, was a gateway for learning and incorporating new methods and techniques. Through the help of the lectures that were available to us and through research from google and YouTube, I was able to build and practice my skills with each assignment.  One extremely important thing I realised, not just with the web portfolio assignment, but also with the mid-term, was how crucial it is to focus on Grids and Margins while creating your web design. Implementing the code for your design becomes so much more structured and straightforward when the mock-up itself follows proper Grids and margins. I also learned that it is absolutely necessary to test the responsive states on different devices. The responsive view is a nice guide to have, but it no way near gives a fully accurate representation.
Another important element was learning how to breakdown your design and structure the HTML accordingly. Before actually writing the HTML, I sat down with a pencil and paper and went over exactly how I would need to structure my code and where I would need to create the necessary div and add classes. There is quite a bit that I learned and I thoroughly enjoyed each assignment, but I have a long way to go.
