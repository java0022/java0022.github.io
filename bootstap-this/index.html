        <p class=" display-6 mt-5 fw-normal ">What is Bootstrap?</p>
        <p class="bg-light mb-5">Bootstrap is a free, open-source HTML, CSS and Javascript framework which is used by
          web
          developers to create
          websites and web applications with a clean and consistent layout.The framework consists of pre-built classes
          that are used to style and structure the website. Bootstrap is entirely responsive and uses the mobile-first
          approach and is completely customizable. This framework is a powerful tool that can help developers build
          responsive mockups at a faster rate. </p>

        <h2 class="fs-2 mt-3 ">Key Features</h2>
        <p class="fs-4 mt-3 fw-bold">Bootstrap Grid</p>
        <p>The Bootstrap Grid is a very powerful tool that utilizes a 12-column grid system to structure the content,
          layout, and design. It is a fully responsive system, that is, the structure and alignment of the content
          changes when the browser is re-seized, and it is built using flexbox. The Bootstrap Grid system is very easy
          to follow and presents a fast and effective method to creating complex designs.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="row border border-success border-3 px-1 py-1">
          <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3 mb-3 ">
            1. The three important elements to keep in mind while creating the Bootstrap Grid are “container” “row” and
            “columns” which are basically the building blocks of the Bootstrap Grid system. In order set up the
            structure, we first use the <strong>.container</strong> to center or align our content. The
            <strong>.row</strong> acts as a wrapper or section
            for the number of columns we want to create. The class <strong>.col</strong> is used to create the columns
            and it is
            important to note that the class <strong>.col</strong> is a child element of <strong>.row.</strong>
          </div>
          <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3  mb-3">
            2. Since the Grid system follows a 12-column layout, we have to divide the number of columns we want to
            create by 12 and use that number to specify the number of columns we need. For example, if we want to create
            3 equal columns, we will give each column a class of .col-4. It is important to note that the total for all
            numbers equals 12, otherwise the column wraps to the second row.
          </div>
          <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3 mb-3">
            3. The Bootstrap Grid system also makes use of a series of “breakpoints” that act as media queries and makes
            the layout responsive. The breakpoints include extra-small (xs), small (sm), medium (md), large (lg),
            extra-large (xl), extra-extra large (xxl) and are written as .col, .col-sm, .col-md, .col-lg, .col-xl and
            .col-xxl respectively.
          </div>
          <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-3 mb-3">
            4. Gutters are the padding or space between every column. By default the gutter-width between each column is
            24px, but it can be easily adjusted by using the classes .gx or gy (Horizontal gutters and Vertical gutters)

      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Alerts</p>
      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        Alerts are a very significant aspect of a website and instantly draws the user’s attention to an important part
        or message displayed by the website. It could pertain to a number of things such as a warning sign, successful
        implementation of an action or even additional notes that can give the user useful information. Bootstrap makes
        it incredibly easy to incorporate Alerts into the design by using the class <strong>.alert</strong>. We can
        even change the background color of the alerts to add emphasis to the message.
      </div>
      <p class="fs-5 fw-bold">Buttons</p>
      <p>Buttons are another useful and important Bootstrap component. Buttons are a gateway to all the pages that make
        up a website and Bootstrap makes it incredibly easy to not only include buttons but also provide a lot of
        options to customize them according to our own needs. The. btn class isn’t just limited to the 'button' tag. It
        can even be used on 'a' and 'input' tags. Not only can we change the color of the buttons, we can also
        incorporate colored button outlines and we can increase the sizes of the buttons as well. </p>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary mb-3">Click</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary mb-3 ">Here</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg mb-3">Large button</button>
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm mb-3">Small button</button>

      <div class="card text-white bg-secondary mb-3 mt-3" style="max-width: 500px;">

            class="card-img-top mb-3" alt="image of books">
          <h5 class="card-title">Information</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Cards are also another powerful Bootstrap component. They’re essentially content
            containers that house a variety of information ranging from images to text to buttons and even links and
            lists. Cards by default have no fixed width so they always take the full width of their parent container.
            The width must be added in the cards in order to size them appropriately. </p>
